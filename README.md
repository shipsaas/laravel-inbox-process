Talking about distributed computers & servers, it is quite normal nowadays to communicate between servers.

Unlike a regular conversation though, there's no guarantee the message gets delivered only once, arrives in the right order, or even gets a "got it!" reply.

Thus, we have **Inbox Pattern** to help us to achieve that.

## What is the Inbox Pattern

**The Inbox Pattern** is a popular design pattern in the microservice architecture that ensures:

- High availability ✅
- Guaranteed webhook deliverance, no msg lost ✅
- Guaranteed **exactly-once/unique** webhook requests ✅
- Execute webhook requests **in ORDER/sequence** ✅
- (Optional) High visibility & debug all prev requests ✅

And with that being said:

**Laravel Inbox Process (powered by ShipSaaS)** ships everything out-of-the-box and 
helps you to roll out the inbox process in no time 😎🚀.

## Supports
- Laravel 10+
